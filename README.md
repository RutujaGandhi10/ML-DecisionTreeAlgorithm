# Machine Learning - Decision Tree Algorithm
To explore decision tree classifier and to visualize the decision tree in different ways to predict right class for new data with simple simple but famous dataset - "Iris"

Ways used to visualize the Decision Tree

1. By printing text representation of the tree with sklearn.tree.export_text method
2. Plotting the tree plot with sklearn.tree.plot_tree method(matplotlib)
3. Plotting the graph with sklearn.tree.export_graphviz method(graphviz)
4. Plotting the tree graph with dtreeviz package(dtreeviz)
